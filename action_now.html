									There are many low risk oppertunities available for you to either try out bioinformatics or learn about
									the related skills. I will give some examples of the oppertunities I have personally taken advanged of
									and proven to be helpful by many peers.
								</p>

								<p>
									<strong>Take an introductory course</strong>
									<br>
									Nowadays, most colleges with well established biology department offer bioinformatics courses designed
									for students without any coding background. For example, at UCSD, 
									<a href="https://bioboot.github.io/bimm143_F21/" 
									style="color:blue; text-decoration: underline;">BIMM 143 </a>
									is a great start for 
									picking up some introductory knowledge of bioinformatics.
									One thing to note about bioinformatics skills is that for the students aiming to be part of the academia,
									bioinformatics applications are not a binary career option. It often becomes a spectrum of how much
									bioinformatics analysis you choose to do out of the other tasks such as wet-lab data generation.
									Therefore, you do not need to fully commit yourself to all the tasks of bioinformatics, as you can
									step-by-step build up useful skills that can weave into part of your future work and make you
									work more efficiently.
								</p>

								<p>
									<strong>Learn Simple Coding Online</strong>
									<br>
									There are many good sites offering free introductory coding lessons. The best site that I have tried 
									was 
									<a href="https://www.datacamp.com/" 
									style="color:blue; text-decoration: underline;">Datacamp</a>.
									It offers all entry-level the bioinformatics languages in one place, including R, Python, and UNIX commandline.
									Moreover, it also has specifically tailored courses in using bioinformatics packages such as RNA-seq analysis
									using DESeq2. A major benefit of using interactive site such as Datacamp is that they offer well-designed responses
									for most common bugs people encounter during coding. The readily available helps speed up the learning process and 
									reduce a lot of the frustration people have when first started coding.
								</p>

								<p>
									<strong>Take a Look at My Bash Tutorial</strong>
									<br>
									I have written a guide to bash shell scripting, the most fundamental language that all bioinformaticians use 
									when they are on the server. The 
									<a href="Intro_to_bash.pdf" download style="color:blue; text-decoration: underline;">guide</a> 
									is a little dense, but with it,
									I hope readers can at least gain the necessary background, so they can further research online when they have
									questions. When I first learnt bash, the lack of exposure to the professional terminalagies made searching online
									incredibly hard. Through this guide, I hope I can help to quickly bridge the gap for people to gain an understanding
									in bash and ask the right questions when they are stuck.
								</p>

								<p>
									<strong>Browse StackOverFlow when Stuck</strong>
									<br>

									When encountering coding related problems, StackOverFlow is a great place to ask for help or search for common solution. Although 
									<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" 
									style="color:blue; text-decoration: underline;">StackOverFlow</a>
									is an open Q&A forum, it contains highly credible answers from individuals who are highly skilled in the subject.
									This is a gathering place for all the "geeks", or computer enthusiasts, to help each other and newcomers to solve
									problems. Whenever you see answers with more than 30-upvotes, it is likely the answer is incredibly legit. In our 
									experience, many of the CSE department professors are active users and contributers to this site.
								</p>

								<p>
									<strong>Chat with Onsite Bioinformaticians</strong>
									<br>

									Almost all well established biology research institution has their own on-site bioinformatician. (This is another reflection
									on how vital bioinformatican are to modern biology researches.) If you work in a lab or have access to one, it would be a great oppertunity
									to take that one extra step in reaching out to them. They are the true experts of the field, and their opinions are way better than mine!

								</p>

								<p>
									<strong>Attend Seminar</strong>
									<br>

									Most schools have open-course graduate-level seminars that allow audits. This is especially true for bioinformatics because nowadays
									zoom presentation for bioinformatic techniques is super low cost and is an easy way to reach into student body. For example, at 
									UCSD, you can view all the schedule and sign up for seminars at
									<a href="https://bioinformatics.ucsd.edu/calendar" 
									style="color:blue; text-decoration: underline;">this site</a>.
									The speakers are usually enthusiasts that wish more people to hear what they are about to say; thus, they are likely going to give you
									a warm welcome even though you are just an undergrad.
								</p>
								
								<p>
									<strong>Good Textbook for Algorithms</strong>
									<br>

									The book "Bioinformatics Algorithms!" is a comprehensive summary of some of the most cutting edge algorithms employed in
									most bioinformaticians' toolbox. This book is written by the world's leading bioinformaticians, Dr. Pavel and Dr. Compeau, who each
									built the bioinformatics foundation at their respective school, USSD and Carnegie Mellon University.
									<a href="https://www.bioinformaticsalgorithms.org/bioinformatics-chapter-1" style="color:blue; text-decoration: underline;"> Link to the first chapter of "Bioinformatics Algorithms!" </a>
