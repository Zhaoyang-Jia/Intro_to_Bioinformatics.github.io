									This is more like the stereotypical coding job many have imagined a bioinformatician would do. It does exist and play a vital role, 
									but most of the participants are from a computer science or mathematics background. 
								</p>
								<p>
									An Algorithmic Computational Biologist performs tasks very similar to a typical software engineer, 
									except they specialize in making softwares for the field of biology. Just like a game software engineer
									 would be required to have some knowledge in gamer psychology and user interface design, a software engineer 
									 specialized in biology tasks requires a subset of knowledge in biology. However, you only need to know the basics 
									 of how biology functions, and the details are filled by the experts whom you would be developing the software for.
								</p>

								<p>
									An example task in this job is to create a package for assembling a Next-Generation Sequencing dataset. We know that 
									NGS data comes in short fragments with many overlaps. The package needs to identify the overlaps and build a mathematical 
									“graph” and resolve this graph to output the finalized assembly.

								</center>

								<p>
									Since we are dealing with big data genearted from the Next Generation Sequencing Machines, the graph usually contain hundreds
									of millions of nodes (much bigger than the one shown above). Therefore, it is not only necessary to create a flawless algorithm, but the efficiency of the algorithm
									is also important.
								</p>
								
								<p>
									This is the farthest and toughest career to transition into bioinformatics if you are from a biology background. 
									You also may not be able to fully utilize your comprehensive biology education. On the other hand, if you are interested in the 
									systematic design of things and wish to empower the everyday researchers with more efficient and effective tools, this may be a good choice for you.
								</p>

									<h2 style="text-align:left; font-size: 38px;">Career Specific Advice</a></h2>
								</header>
								<br>
								<p>
									My suggestion is to try out some introductory data structure and algorithm courses, and see if you are interested and able to conceptualize abstract ideas. 
									Some topics to consider include

									<ol>
										<li>Introduction to Object Oriented Programming</li>
										<li>Discrete Mathematics</li>
										<li>Graph Theory</li>
									</ol>
									
									A particularly low-stake resource is to try to follow alone with the legendary bioinformatician Pavel Pavner.
									 He wrote an open source bioinformatics algorithm textbook, which is accessible at this
