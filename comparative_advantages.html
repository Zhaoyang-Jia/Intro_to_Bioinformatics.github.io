									<strong>Multi-disciplinary</strong>
									<br>
									All of the bioinformatics jobs require collaboration among different fields. Since bioinformaticians 
									stand at the intersections of these field, they often act as an integrator among the experts of different
									subjects. For example, an onsite research bioinformatician would constantly communicate between the wet-lab
									biologists who generate the data and the computer scientists who build the packages. The bioinformatician is
									the one person who can understand both what the wet-lab biologists need specifically and the limitations of
									the programming done by the computer scientist. You will be given the valuable oppertunity to
									talk to each field's respective expert, and overtime, this helps you grow even more in your multi-disciplinary
									background. Such constant communication with people outside of your typical workspace is rarely seen in the 
									field of biology, but it is a routine for the bioinformaticians.
								</p>

								<p>
									<strong>More Creative Tasks</strong>
									<br>
									Even though scientific endeavours are driven by critical thinking, wet-lab biologis still have to spend
									a lot of time performing non-creative, repetitive procedures. On the other hand, bioinformaticians have their
									computers to perform most of the repetitive tasks.

									</center>
									The task of building computer automated pipelines is actually a highly creative task. It requires constant 
									critical reflection by the bioinformatician, to determine what is needed to be generated from the pipeline
									and how can the pipeline take on more work to reduce the downstream manual analysis workload. A
									good reusable pipeline can often be used on dozens of later analysis, and based on the specific needs of the
									analysis, the bioinformatician need to make small adjustment to fit the needs. With well designed reusable pipelines
									built and documented, most of the incoming data can be directly analyzed by the previous pipeline, reducing repetitive
									work. Moreover, many had the impression that people who work with code spend most of their time debugging, but this
									is mostly not true for the bioinformaticians. Since most of the complex packages are built by the
									individuals specialized in computer science, there is few complex bugs that can bother the bioinformatican.

									<strong>Higher Salary</strong>
									<br>
									<center>
										<img src="images/salary.png" width=1000 style="margin: 20px 0px 20px 0px"/>
									</center>
									As seen by the data from
									<a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/computer-and-information-research-scientists.htm" 
									style="color:blue; text-decoration: underline;">US Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>,
									bioinformatics (categorized as information research scientist), earns almost double the salary of a typical wet-lab
									biologist. This significant gap is mostly contributed by the supple and demand of the labor market. There is an
									insufficient number of bioinformatican being trained relative to the new job openings presented each year. This trend
									is likely to continue for a while because the high market growth is projected to last at least a decade.
									
								</p>

								<p>
									<strong>High Growth in the Field</strong>
									<br>
									Although biology is also a fast growing field, biology's growth rate is nowhere near that of bioinformatics. According to the same
									US Bureau of Labor statistics, bioinformatics is projected to grow for about 22% in the next decade, and such vigrous growth is 
									rarely seen in any field. This high rate of growth and the ever growthing salary signifies vacancy in the field. Most scientists chose
									their career because they wish to help the world by advancing technology, and there is not much of a better oppertunity to help the world
									than filling the 
									bioinformatics vacancy. Huge quantity of data are currently sitting waiting to be analyzed. This means many of the wet-lab biologists'
									contribution would be delayed just because there is a lack in bioinformatican. If you join this field and help fill the gap,
									you would likely be better helping the world in doing research compare to actually perform the experiments yourself. Plus, you will get
									a better salary and a lower rate of unemployment.
