									NIH. (2021). <i>The cost of sequencing a human genome.</i> Genome.gov. from <a href="https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/Sequencing-Human-Genome-cost">https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/Sequencing-Human-Genome-cost</a>
								</p>
									
								
								This is a cost analysis published by the National Institute of Health in 2021. The major conclusion is in the past two decades,
								the cost of sequence DNA information has been reduced by more than 10000-fold. This is a drastic decrease in cost even when compared
								to the booming computer industry, for which during the same time period, the personal/industrial computing power's cost only decreased by about 
								100-fold. The NIH also projected the cost of sequencing is going to further decrease in a similar trend. With this steep decrease in cost, the NIH
								argued that research capability and private sector activities shall continue to expand in the near decade.

									U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. (2022, April 18). <i>Computer and Information Research Scientists : Occupational outlook handbook.</i> from <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/computer-and-information-research-scientists.htm">https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/computer-and-information-research-scientists.htm</a>  </b>
								</p>
								 According to the most recent US Bureau of Labor Statistics, bioinformaticians belong to the subcategory of "Computer and 
								Information Research Scientists". This group of people enjoy an average annual salary of $131,490, which is significantly higher
								than the average income of $58,260. Moreover, the occupation of bioinformaticians has a master degree as the typical "entry-level of 
								education", which is lower than the phD required for other research-oriented occupations. The job outlook in the next decade sees
								a staggering 22% growth, which is among the top growing job sectors.

									U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. (2022, April 18). <i>Microbiologists : Occupational outlook handbook.</i> from <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/life-physical-and-social-science/microbiologists.htm">https://www.bls.gov/ooh/life-physical-and-social-science/microbiologists.htm</a>  </b>
								</p>
								According to the most recent US Bureau of Labor Statistics, microbiologists, a good representation of the wet-lab biologists
								have an average annual salary of $79,260. Being a higher education ocupation, this is higher than the average income in the US, but
								it is still significantly lower than bioinformatician. Additionally, the growth of the job market is relatively slow in the next decade,
								at 5%.

								Dr. Pevzner is a global leader in bioinformatics algorithm. For those who are interested in learning more about algorithmic computational biology,
								this book is a must read. It contains most of the cutting edge algorithm used everyday in the bioinformaticians' toolkit. At this link,
								the first chapter of the book is free for reading. It can serve as a good starting point for exploration.
