									This is a career that is suitable for individuals who are interested in both biology and chemistry. 
									This is also one of the most popular careers of a biologist working in the pharmaceutical industry. 
									One is required to understand the chemistry behind molecular interactions and produce a virtual model for the docking of a drug against its target protein.
								</p>

									frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen>
									</iframe>
								</center>

								<p>
									This job requires very little coding experience, and sometimes, none at all. However, it requires a 
									thorough training in the software used by the pharmaceutical industry to produce virtual screening results, 
									compare and contrast against different drug models, and finalize the product for chemical engineers to synthesize.
								</p>
								
								<p>
									If you were pursuing a biochemistry major, this can likely be a good career choice for you. By utilizing the massive 
									computing power of the modern machine, a structural biologist can screen through tens of thousands of potential drug 
									models and propose the best dozens for real-world synthesis. This working pipeline is extremely beneficial for the 
									pharmaceutical company as virtual modeling is a lot less expensive than actually building the chemical and testing it out.

								</header>
								<br>
								<p>
									One downside for this career is that the training in the modeling softwares is often not included in the typical education 
									in college. It is required for you to pay for the additional training by the software company, or if you are well suited, 
									convince your future drug company to cover it for you.

									Above is a Schrodinger Maestro interface. This is one of the leading softwares in virtual screening of ligand-protein
									interactions. We see that the functionalities on the interface is highly specific, and in-depth training is required 
									to be able to fluently perform
									the tasks. Schrodinger offers their own trainings in the software, including the necessary cloud computing power at their 
									<a href="https://www.schrodinger.com/learn/training/schrodinger-online-learning" style="color:blue; text-decoration: underline;">site</a>.
									A typical 40-hour long course would cost around $500.
									
								</p>
								
								<p>
									However, in contrast to the higher starting cost, this is one of the highest paid pharmaceutical careers a biologist can pursue.
