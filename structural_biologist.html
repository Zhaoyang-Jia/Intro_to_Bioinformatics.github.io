									<b> NIH. (2021). <i>The cost of sequencing a human genome.</i> Genome.gov. from <a href="https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/Sequencing-Human-Genome-cost">https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/Sequencing-Human-Genome-cost</a> </b>
								</h1>
								<br> This is a cost analysis published by the National Institute of Health in 2021. The major conclusion is in the past two decades,
								the cost of sequence DNA information has been reduced by more than 10000-fold. This is a drastic decrease in cost even when compared
								to the booming computer industry, for which during the same time period, the personal/industrial computing power's cost only decreased by about 
								100-fold. The NIH also projected the cost of sequencing is going to further decrease in a similar trend. With this steep decrease in cost, the NIH
								argued that research capability and private sector activities shall continue to expand in the near decade.

(2022, April 18). <i>Computer and Information Research Scientists : Occupational outlook handbook.</i> from <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/computer-and-information-research-scientists.htm">https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/computer-and-information-research-scientists.htm</a>  </b>
								</h1>
								<br> According to the most recent US Bureau of Labor Statistics, bioinformaticians belong to the subcategory of "Computer and 
								Information Research Scientists". This group of people enjoy an average annual salary of $131,490, which is significantly higher
								than the average income of $58,260. This wage is also higher than the average molecular biology researchers at $102,270. (Both 
								data gathered at the same site) Moreover, the occupation of bioinformaticians has a master degree as the typical "entry-level of 
								education", which is lower than the phD required for other research-oriented occupations. The job outlook in the next decade sees
								a staggering 22% growth, which is among the top growing job sectors.
